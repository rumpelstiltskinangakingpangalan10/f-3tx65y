            <br> <!--[EDIT]SUPPORTING DETAILS--> 
            <p class = "paragraphs">Aloe vera is a popular natural remedy for acne due to its anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties. It has been used for centuries to soothe and heal various skin conditions, including acne. Aloe vera can help to reduce the appearance of redness, swelling, and scarring caused by acne, making it an effective and affordable treatment option for those with mild to moderate acne. It also helps to moisturize and nourish the skin, promoting healthy skin cell growth and improving overall skin texture.</p>
            <br>
            <p class = "paragraphs">Aloe vera products are widely available on the market, ranging from pure aloe vera gel to aloe vera-infused skincare products. Aloe vera gel can be applied directly to the skin as a mask or spot treatment, or it can be mixed with other natural ingredients like honey or lemon juice to enhance its benefits. Aloe vera is also a common ingredient in many commercial skincare products, including cleansers, toners, and moisturizers. When selecting an aloe vera product, it's important to read the label carefully and look for pure, high-quality ingredients without added fragrances or harsh chemicals that could irritate the skin.</p>
            <br>
            <p class = "paragraphs">One of the most popular aloe vera products is LUXE ORGANIX 99% Aloe Vera Soothing Gel 300ml. This is an alternative option if finding an organic aloe vera plant is a challenge in your area. You can buy this at any Watson’s branch if available or order it online.</p>

            <br> <!--[EDIT]SUPPORTING DETAILS--> 
            <p class = "paragraphs">Honey is another natural antibacterial and anti-inflammatory agent that can be used to effectively treat acne. The antioxidants and enzymes found in honey can help to reduce inflammation and redness, while its antibacterial properties help to fight against the bacteria that cause acne. Honey can also help to soothe and hydrate the skin, improving overall skin texture and promoting healthy skin cell growth.</p>
            <br>
            <p class = "paragraphs">To use honey for acne, simply apply a small amount of honey to the affected area as a spot treatment, or use it as a face mask by mixing honey with other natural ingredients like turmeric or cinnamon. Leave the honey on for 15-20 minutes before rinsing it off with warm water. Honey can be used daily as part of a regular skincare routine to help prevent and treat acne breakouts.</p>
            <br>
            <p class = "paragraphs">Honey products are widely available on the market and can be used to promote healthy, glowing skin. From honey-infused skincare products like Belo Acne Pro Pimple Gel, it is more convenient to apply this on your face when you are at work or overnight as this requires a very small amount and is not as obvious as natural honey.</p>

            <br> <!--[EDIT]SUPPORTING DETAILS--> 
            <p class = "paragraphs">Oregano is a common herb that is often used in cooking, but it also has powerful antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties that can be effective in treating acne. Oregano oil contains a compound called carvacrol, which has been found to have strong antimicrobial effects against acne-causing bacteria. Oregano oil can be applied topically to the skin, diluted in a carrier oil like coconut or olive oil, to help reduce inflammation and prevent future breakouts.</p>
            <br>
            <p class = "paragraphs">To use oregano oil for acne, mix a few drops of oregano oil with a carrier oil and apply it to the affected area. It's important to test the oil on a small patch of skin before applying it to the entire face to ensure that there is no adverse reaction. Alternatively, you can pick a small to large oregano leaf and cut shallow lines on the surface to excrete the essence. Then, patch in on the acne spot with gauze tape or a band-aid.</p>
            <br>
            <p class = "paragraphs">Oregano products are becoming increasingly popular for their natural and effective skincare benefits. In fact, you can get oregano essential oils online to use for your acne inflammation if the oregano plant itself is not available in your area.</p>

            <p class = "paragraphs">Rice water is a traditional beauty treatment that has been used for centuries in Asia. It is the starchy water that is left over after soaking or boiling rice, and it is rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Rice water can be an effective natural remedy for acne due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. It can help to reduce inflammation and redness, while also improving overall skin texture and tone.</p>
            <br>
            <p class = "paragraphs">To use rice water for acne, simply soak a clean cotton pad or cotton ball in rice water and apply it to the affected areas of the face. Leave it on for 10-15 minutes before rinsing it off with warm water. Rice water can also be used as a facial toner by applying it to the face with a spray bottle. Regular use of rice water can help to promote clear and healthy skin, and it can also be used as a natural alternative to traditional acne treatments.</p>
            <br>
            <p class = "paragraphs">Rice water products are becoming increasingly popular in the skincare industry due to their natural and effective skincare benefits. From facial cleansers and toners to serums and moisturizers, rice water is a powerful ingredient that can help to promote clear and healthy skin. One option is the ROREC Rice White Skin Beauty Serum if you need an on-the-go, small-sized rice essence. This is available online and better alternative if you need to use this more than once a day outdoors.</p>

            <p class = "paragraphs">Last on our list for natural anti-inflammatory is Cucumber - a natural ingredient that can help to soothe and heal acne-prone skin. It has cooling and hydrating properties that can help to reduce inflammation, redness, and irritation. Cucumber contains antioxidants and vitamin C that can help to promote healthy skin by protecting against environmental stressors and promoting collagen production. Its high water content also helps to hydrate and nourish the skin, improving overall texture and tone.</p>
            <br>
            <p class = "paragraphs">To use cucumber for acne, slice a chilled cucumber and apply it directly to the affected areas of the face. Leave it on for 10-15 minutes before rinsing it off with cool water. Cucumber can also be blended into a face mask by combining it with other natural ingredients like honey, yogurt, or aloe vera. Regular use of cucumber on the face can help to promote clear and healthy skin.</p>
            <br>
            <p class = "paragraphs">Cucumber products are a popular choice in the skincare industry due to their natural and gentle properties.

            <p class="paragraphs">Acne can be a frustrating and often stubborn skin condition, but natural remedies can be an effective way to promote healthy and clear skin. While natural remedies can be a great addition to a comprehensive acne treatment plan, it's important to remember that not all natural ingredients are created equal. It's important to do your research and speak with a healthcare professional before trying any new natural remedies to ensure that they are safe and effective for your skin type and specific needs.</p>
